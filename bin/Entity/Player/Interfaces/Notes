Idea of this class is to offer several screens to draw through

Stop updating on the current map

Have a pause boolean that pauses updating on the background and when paused, it will bring up this screen.

Screens
Inventory
When selected, reset all of players sprites since they are static.

Quests
When selected, have a read out of all quests completed, when highlighted over, do like the menu screen.
When highlighted over and pressed enter, a box will appear reading out the next set of directions to do.

Stats
Have each mana, strength, defense, health, and gold displayed here. Have a neat health bar.

HAVE HUD IN THIS ALSO TO STOP UPDATING AND TO STOP DRAWING!
